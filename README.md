# Project-Arizona-Procedural-Generation
 This part of our project was made as a proof of concept, using a guide from Sebastian Lague.
 
 That guide can be found here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eBW2EiBtl_sxmDtSgZBxB3
 
 This college level summary, and guided example, of how to create a procedurally generating enviroment is what we followed along with to learn how to build a procedurally generating world.
